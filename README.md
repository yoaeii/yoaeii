- I'm a developer who mostly works solo. My ambition is to create various projects based on my admiration and desire to improve or automate various systems created by me and other people.

- I'm always glad to communicate with new people, whether it is correct criticism, or mutual help, or maybe just communication. My social networks are listed in the section below. If you want to ask me a question or ask for help, then write to me at any time, preferably immediately clarifying your goal, https://nohello.net/ is an example of this.

- **[LuaU](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau)**: because I spent most of my time creating projects in Roblox on the two sides of exploitation and honest development. So to speak, classification as blue-hat, white-hat and black-hat. For this reason, this my main language, and all the others are additional.

- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: which I mostly use to create mini-projects like discord-chat-bot, or automated systems for my own benefit or the benefit of other people.
