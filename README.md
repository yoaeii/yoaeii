<br/>


- I'm a freelance developer who mostly works solo. My ambition is to create various projects based on my admiration and desire to improve or automate various systems created by me and other people.
  
- I've been specializing in LuaU for about 3-4 years now. I'm also related to creating a graphical interfaces, its operations, and mini-react automations, so I can consider myself both a back-end and front-end developer. My projects include a large number of interface libraries, created both for myself and for other people in order.

- In fact, my hobbies go into different areas. Whether it's animation, design, and so on. That's because I'm working alone so I'm always creating something on my own. I don't mind working in a good team, but most of the time all my projects involved only one person.

- No, I don't ignore the purity of the code and the neatness of my work. I have always adhered to perfectionism and tried to become a better person in order to create high-quality work. Obviously, there is no ideal, but I always adhere to the good readability of my code, or the type of my visual work.

- I'm always glad to communicate with new people, whether it is correct criticism, or mutual help, or maybe just communication. My social networks are listed in the section below. If you want to ask me a question or ask for help, then write to me at any time, preferably immediately clarifying your goal, https://nohello.net/ is an example of this.

- **[LuaU](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau) & [Lua](https://www.lua.org/docs.html)**: because I spent most of my time creating projects in Roblox on the two sides of exploitation and honest development. So to speak, classification as blue-hat, white-hat and black-hat. For this reason, this my main language, and all the others are additional.

- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: which I mostly use to create mini-projects like discord-chat-bot, or automated systems for my own benefit or the benefit of other people.
